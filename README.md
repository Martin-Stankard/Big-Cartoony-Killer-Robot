Never getting to this ... it is like a very aggressive agent ui with visuals. 

I like ai for coding and f no am I interested in setting it up with outside scope, even with big glowy arrows telling me "About to click this, ok?" , I don't even like my agents to use a search tool as I can find more than enough to add to a rag via web scraping in 10 minutes. If I get to an ai lifecoach/task master agent system...this will make more sense.

*-"I am going for Clippy on Acid"*

An SVG-centric, Gen AI UI overlay, to help show and explain what &lt;generic agent api> wants to do in a browser. Lots of Balloony Font Awesome pointing at and glowing/fx'ing. Red, Smoke indicating a 10 on the AI danger meter/ email and credit cards in my house. 

Pie in the sky, saas with chrome plugin. The agent part screens local ollama agent something.

This honestly feels like a gambling warning necessary place. I can see ai whipping up ecommerce stores and spending money on ads with waaaay worse odds than Black Jack
